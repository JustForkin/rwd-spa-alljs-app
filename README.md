<h3>Responsive Single Page Application using an end to end Java Script stack</h3>
<br>
This is an attempt to build a SPA using an all Java Script stack. 
<br>
1) The theme for the application is a sample travel and tourism site using places in India as source and the plan is to add social elements to the same.<br>
2) The application will be using a travel destinations database persistence on MongoDB <br>
3) Server will be Node.js using the Connect module for the Web Application Hosting <br>
4) RESTful CRUD APIs will be exposed on Node.js server using the  MongoDB driver module <br>
5) AngularJS will be used to build the SPA with Bootstrap providing the UI components. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Added so far</h4><br>
1) Basic SPA infrastructure for Node.js/AngularJS/Bootstrap/Express/Connect/MongoDB<br>
2) Initial set of travel APIs (CRUD) for all destinations in India using MongoDB for persistence.<br>
3) A Bootstrap Carousel for India Travel Destinations (Need improvement :-))<br>
4) Accordian view of all India Destinations sourced from the travel APIs with filters<br>
5) Group By view of all India Destinations grouped by India Region and State<br>
<br>
Work in Progress ...
