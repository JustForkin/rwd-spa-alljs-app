=================

Responsive Single Page Application using an end to end Java Script stack
<br>
This is an attempt to build a SPA using an all Java Script stack. 
<br>
1) The theme for the application is a sample travel and tourism site using places in India as source and the plan is to add social elements to the same.<br>
2) The application will be using a travel destinations database persistence on MongoDB <br>
3) Server will be Node.js using the Connect module for the Web Application Hosting <br>
4) RESTful CRUD APIs will be exposed on Node.js server using the  MongoDB driver module <br>
5) AngularJS will be used to build the SPA with Bootstrap providing the UI components. <br>
<br>
<br>
Added so far
1) Basic SPA infrastructure for Node.js/AngularJS/Bootstrap/Express/Connect/MongoDB
2) Initial set of travel APIs (CRUD) for all destinations in India using MongoDB for persistence.
3) A Bootstrap Carousel for India Travel Destinations (Need improvement :-))
4) Accordian view of all India Destinations sourced from the travel APIs with filters
5) Group By view of all India Destinations grouped by India Region and State

Work in Progress ...
